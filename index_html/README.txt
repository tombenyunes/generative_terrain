Must be run in a web server.
Downloads take a bit of time to load, and file sizes are quite large for full-size terrain downloads (200/300MB).
It is recommended to refresh the page after completing a download, as three.js doesn't always correctly dispose of the required memory.
If your computer can handle it, it is recommended to use the full 512x512 dimensions for the best experience. However, if you experience performance issues it is worth considering reducing the world dimensions and ensuring you are on 'basic' water type, as 'advanced' is graphically intensive and increases loading times.
